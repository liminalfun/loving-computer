this group is inspired by a reading space [sadada](https://www.instagram.com/sadada.space/) & shawn mcguffey co-hosted on sunday afternoons from april-june. please offer your respect and support to these educators for catalyzing this!

** for folks who benefit from whiteness (or proximity to whiteness), i ask that you utilize this space to read about dismantling white supremacy, practicing transformative justice, and visioning how we can activate what we learn.
